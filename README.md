# willMe-INT-1.1


I created this to solve the issue of leaving financial burden on a family member after a loved ones death. I figured if I make a simple web app, people would use it to create a their final wishes and a will so that family members and loved ones would be able to mourn in peace, and not have to worry about the financial burden that comes with it. (Later On - through the app) willMe will walk you through creating a profile, customizing that profile, creating a final will and testament, storing photos and videos in the vault to be opened at a later time, and navigating any other of your questions surrounding mortality.

Motivation

Over the past year and a half I have worked at a funeral home. I have seen how big the financial burden is on a person who passed before they ever set up a will or made pre-arrangements. I'd like to solve this issue through willMe.
